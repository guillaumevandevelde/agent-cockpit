## Release Focus: Codex Support

The next release makes Codex CLI a stable provider in Agent Cockpit. Codex sessions can live next to Claude Code sessions in Agent Bridge, and the Config page now includes a Codex-specific editor for safe TOML settings, profile diagnostics, MCP/plugin inventory, and feature flags from `codex features list`.

Agent Cockpit still keeps provider boundaries explicit. Codex usage metrics, context charts, and transcript browsing are not shown as if they were Claude Code data. Codex backups are redacted exports and automatic restore is refused until Codex exposes a safe restore contract.
