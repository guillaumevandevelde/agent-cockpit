# Agent Bridge

Agent Bridge discovers and manages local agent CLIs running inside tmux. It supports mixed Claude Code and Codex CLI sessions in the same view.

## Overview

The bridge performs a provider-aware tmux discovery pass and classifies each matching pane as `claude-code` or `codex-cli`. The UI can show all sessions together or filter to one provider.

Session cards include:

- Provider badge
- tmux target
- Current working directory
- Live preview
- Attach, fullscreen, and kill controls

The terminal grid is shared across providers. Read-only and interactive modes work the same way whether the pane is Claude Code or Codex.

Provider filters are explicit:

- **All** — mixed Claude Code and Codex sessions
- **Claude Code** — Claude Code panes only
- **Codex** — Codex panes only

## New Sessions

The new session dialog starts with a provider choice.

Claude Code keeps the existing session modes:

- Plain session
- Worktree session
- Resume session

Codex CLI supports:

- New session with `codex --cd <directory>`
- Resume by session id or `--last`
- Fork by session id or `--last`
- Optional model, profile, profile v2, sandbox, approval policy, web search, and prompt seed

Dangerous Codex bypass mode is exposed as an explicit advanced option because it disables approval and sandbox protections.

## Compatibility

The frontend route `/agent-bridge` is the primary route. `/cc-bridge` remains as a compatibility alias.

The backend keeps `/api/v1/cc-bridge/*` for existing callers and adds `/api/v1/agent-bridge/*` for provider-aware clients.

## Smoke Coverage

Multi-provider smoke checks should cover mixed discovery, provider filters, attach/read-only/interactive terminal behavior, Codex spawn/resume/fork options, and the legacy `/cc-bridge` compatibility route. Claude-only transcript, usage, context, plugin, permission, hook, agent, skill, and memory pages should stay hidden or disabled when Codex is the selected provider until provider-aware equivalents exist.
