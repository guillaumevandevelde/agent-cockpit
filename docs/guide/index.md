# Introduction

Claude Cockpit is a self-hosted web application for visualizing and managing local AI coding agents. It started with [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) configuration and now includes stable Codex CLI support for tmux sessions, safe TOML settings, feature flags, diagnostics, MCP/plugin inventory, and redacted config exports.

## Why Claude Cockpit?

Claude Code stores configuration across multiple JSON files and directories (`~/.claude.json`, `~/.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/settings.json`, `.mcp.json`, and more). Managing these files manually is tedious and error-prone. Claude Cockpit gives you a visual dashboard to:

- **See everything at a glance** — dashboard with counts, session activity, and context window usage
- **Edit configuration visually** — no more hand-editing JSON files
- **Manage MCP servers** — add, test, and configure servers with OAuth support
- **Track usage** — monitor token costs, billing blocks, and daily/monthly trends
- **Browse sessions** — view conversation transcripts with tool use details
- **Monitor live sessions** — attach to running Claude Code and Codex terminals via Agent Bridge
- **Switch providers intentionally** — use shared surfaces for Claude Code and Codex CLI while unsupported provider-specific pages stay hidden or disabled
- **Manage Codex safely** — edit whitelisted TOML settings, inspect feature flags, and run CLI-backed inventory/mutation flows without exposing auth or prompt history

## Features

Claude Cockpit covers Claude Code configuration and the shared local-agent operations layer:

| Category | Features |
|----------|----------|
| **Core Config** | Claude Code settings editor, Codex TOML settings editor, Codex feature flags, MCP servers, slash commands |
| **Extensions** | Plugins, hooks, permissions, agents, skills |
| **Monitoring** | Sessions, usage tracking, context window, Agent Bridge |
| **Customization** | Output styles, status line, memory |
| **Management** | Projects, plans, backup & restore |

## Provider Support

Claude Cockpit exposes provider capabilities and status through the Providers API. Claude Code remains the full-featured provider for usage, context, transcripts, plugins, hooks, agents, skills, memory, backup, and restore. Codex CLI support focuses on mixed tmux sessions, safe TOML configuration, feature flags, diagnostics, MCP/plugin inventory and safe CLI-backed mutations, and redacted export-only backups.

See [Multi-Provider and Codex CLI](/guide/multi-provider-codex-v2) for the supported, diagnostics-only, and unsupported Codex surfaces.
