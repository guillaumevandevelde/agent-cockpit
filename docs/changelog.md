# Changelog

All notable changes to Claude Cockpit are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## 1.3.0 — 2026-06-08

### Added

- **Codex CLI support** is now stable enough for daily use:
  - Mixed Claude Code and Codex tmux sessions in Agent Bridge
  - Codex spawn, resume, fork, attach, and kill actions
  - Provider-aware navigation so Codex users do not land on unsupported Claude-only pages
- **Codex Config**:
  - Safe TOML editing for whitelisted scalar settings and feature flags
  - Dropdowns for known Codex runtime values
  - Help tooltips for documented settings and feature flags
  - Feature inventory from `codex features list`, including goals and other enable-flag features
  - Profile diagnostics for active/default profiles, profile files, overrides, missing references, and malformed profiles
- **Codex MCP and Plugins**:
  - MCP inventory from `codex mcp list --json`
  - MCP add/remove through the Codex CLI with validation
  - Plugin inventory from `codex plugin list`
  - Plugin install/remove where the installed Codex CLI exposes safe commands
- **Codex Backup Export**:
  - Redacted export-only backups for config, profile files, rules, and provider inventory metadata
- **Projects**:
  - Easier project discovery and directory browsing when adding project paths

### Changed

- Provider status, capabilities, diagnostics, and normalized provider errors now drive more of the UI.
- The frontend toolchain now uses TypeScript 6, `@vitejs/plugin-react` 5, updated ESLint tooling, React DOM, PostCSS, Tailwind Merge, and Node types.

### Security

- Codex auth, history, model cache, SQLite state, prompt text, and raw cache payloads are still excluded from raw viewers and backups.
- Automatic Codex restore remains disabled because exports intentionally omit provider-owned local state.

## 1.2.0 — 2026-04-22

### Added

- **CC Bridge** — live terminal bridge to Claude Code sessions in tmux
  - Multi-terminal grid (up to 4 panes in auto-layout)
  - Per-pane read-only/interactive mode, fullscreen, attach/detach
  - Session discovery via `tmux list-panes` with auto-refresh
  - Spawn new sessions (plain, worktree, or resume mode)
  - Kill sessions with optional worktree cleanup
  - WebSocket PTY relay with xterm.js (WebGL rendering)

### Fixed

- **CC Bridge** — prevent orphaned `tmux attach-session` processes on server reload
- **CC Bridge** — fix terminal rendering in React StrictMode
